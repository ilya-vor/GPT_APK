# GPT-Android

# Introduction
I wrote this app because it was inconvenient for me to open GPT in my phone.

What I liked about this program:
1) application format
2) full functionality of GPT 3.5
3) the key is saved when restarting

# Description
The following libraries are used in the work of this app:
1) kivy
2) openai
3) pickle

For the OpenAI library to work, it is required that it works in your country, otherwise use a VPN or proxy.

2)  Write "buildozer android debug" in console
3)  Wait a long time
